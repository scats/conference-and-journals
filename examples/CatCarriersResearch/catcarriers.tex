\section{Introduction}

Cat carrying technology field is one of the fastest growing industries today.
Many people use cat carriers to bring their cats outside \cite{item01}.
Cat carrier products that are on the market currently do not meet demanding
requirements of the modern society.

We performed a deep research in cat carrying problem domain and developed a new
very effective technology of carrying a cat.

\section{Related works}

Traditional cat carriers are classified and described in details in
\cite{item01}, \cite{item02}. Authors of \cite{item03} discuss effectiveness of traditional methods. 

\section{Description of experiment}

A traditional method of carrying a cat is presented on Fig.~\ref{fig:TraditionalCatCarrier}.

The traditional cat carrier is heavy and not space-efficient. While it is
possible to use modern materials to build a lighter carrier in traditional
style we decided to design a cat carrier which consists of less parts.

A proposed design is shown on Fig.~\ref{fig:NewCatCarrier}. It is much simpler
and lighter than the traditional one. It is adjustable to handle a cat of any
size, even a Maine Coon.

\section{Tools}

We used a male 6 years old cat in our experiment. It weighted 5.54 kilograms. We
used a traditional cat carrier produced by Cat Carriers Inc.

Authors also build their own experimental cat carrier using materials bought in
Walmart store.

\section{Results}

No cats ot other pets were harmed during our experiment. We defined a set of
metrics and conducted a survey of 20 randomly selected cat owners.

Combined comparison results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:compare}. We planned directions of future work based on these results.

\section{Future work}

Authors are going to implement a fully autonomous cat carrying system utilizing
a deep learning algorithm.

We will also try to reduce the weight of our existing solution further. 

\section{Conclusion}

A problem of carrying a cat effectively and in style is actual
at the moment and will become even more actual in the future. There is a huge
demand of cat carrying systems which can work 24*7*365 in hard conditions.

Authors presented an innovative solution and performed field testing. The new
tool is better than existing methods of cat carrying by 146\%.
